The purpose of this directory is to cross-compile a 64bit exe for windows. 
Since I don't have access to a windows build machine, I run the mingw gcc 
compiler on ubuntu to produce the windows exe.

Notes:
- sdl_mixer_makefile.in removes the steps to build two executables which failed 
under cross compilation
